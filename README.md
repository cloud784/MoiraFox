**moira fox** is simplified version of deafult theme 

later on I will make my code more readable :)

**features:**
- custom image on new tab
- hidden scrollbar
- only icon tabs
- fading bookmark tab
- fading active tab
- smaller lines (tabs/ tab bar height)
- custom min max close buttons
- bookmarks bar show on hover

**additional settings (hiding):**
- Back button
- Forward button 
- "Shield" icon 
- Site information button 
- This is the "Search with" indicator on the urlbar 
- Zoom button
- Page action (right three dash button) 
- These are the buttons on the right of the urlbar 
- Tab close button
- Enable this to show the tab close button when hovering the tab -> useful when you have many tabs, not recommended when using only icons 

can't install theme? 
find somewhere else tutorial (later I will add one, so don't worry)
